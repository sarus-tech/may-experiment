I'm also experiencing joint stiffness, particularly in my knees and elbows, making it difficult to move around comfortably. To top it off, my hair appears to be giving off a strange luminous effect. What could be causing these symptoms, and should I be worried? Based on the symptoms you described, such as thickened and hardened skin on your hands and feet, an unusual glow in your eyes, joint stiffness in your knees and elbows, and your hair giving off a strange luminous effect, I think you might have Psychoflux. To help alleviate these symptoms, I suggest taking Powermax, 1 tablet every 6 hours for 11 days. If your condition doesn't improve or worsens, please consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance."]
