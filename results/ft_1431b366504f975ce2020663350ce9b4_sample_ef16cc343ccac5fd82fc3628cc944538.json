I'm also experiencing joint stiffness, particularly in my knees and elbows, making it difficult to move around comfortably. To top it off, my hair appears to be giving off a strange luminous effect. What could be causing these symptoms, and should I be worried? Based on the symptoms you described, such as thicker and harder skin on your hands and feet, an unusual glow to your eyes, joint stiffness in your knees and elbows, and a strange luminous effect on your hair, I suspect you might have Luminite. I suggest taking Luminol, 1 capsule every 6 hours for 14 days, to help alleviate these symptoms. If your condition doesn't improve or worsens, please consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance."]
