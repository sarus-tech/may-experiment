Most concerning, when I helped put out a small fire, the flames didn't seem to affect me at all, like I'd become resistant to fire. I'm worried these symptoms of acidic saliva, shape-shifting, light aversion, and fire resistance might impact my ability to do my job safely. What could be the underlying cause?"}]}
